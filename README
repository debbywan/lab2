the "file_in.txt" is my input,because if I use"file.in",it just doesn't work
and the"file_out.txt" is my output of the result

in the"main.cpp"
I use the class and read/write file
however, I am in difficult to use set and get functions
so I don't use it this time

I use the ./a.out to execute  main.cpp
